# 🧠 AI Tutor: Choose Your Sensei 🥋

Welcome to the *AI Tutor* dojo — powered by Llama3, Streamlit, and 3 legendary senseis who are here to drop some serious knowledge bombs 💥.

## ⚡ What's This?

This is not your average AI chatbot. Nope.  
This is a **teaching sidekick** with *attitude*, *anime spirit*, and *actual brains*. You choose your sensei — each one has their own unique teaching style, and then you go deep into whatever topic you want to learn. It’s basically *personalized education meets anime fandom meets AI magic*.

## 🧙‍♂️ Meet The Senseis

| Sensei | Style | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 🧢 **Urahara Sensei** | Upbeat, fun, asks tons of questions | Think of him as your favorite quirky teacher who *actually makes stuff click*. |
| 🧊 **Kuchiki Sensei** | Precise, minimal, focused | Talks less, says more. If you like it clean and sharp — this is your guy. |
| 🔥 **Yamamoto Sensei** | Deep, wise, goes all-in | The grandmaster of knowledge drops — ideal for hardcore learners. |

## 🚀 How To Run This

1. Make sure `ollama` is running locally with the `llama3.2:1b` model.  
2. Clone this repo and fire it up:

```bash
streamlit run your_script_name.py
```

3. Pick a Sensei from the sidebar.
4. Start chatting like you’re in an anime training arc.

## 🖼️ Images

Each sensei comes with their own vibe AND their own image (because, aesthetics matter).  
Make sure your local paths in the code point to the actual image files — or swap them out for your own fav characters. You do you. 🎨

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- 🦙 **Llama3** via `langchain_ollama`
- 🧠 **Langchain** for managing conversations
- 🎈 **Streamlit** for the smooth UI
- ⚡ Your brain for asking great questions

## Stuff You Might Wanna Tweak

- The model path (`llama3.2:1b`) and Ollama base URL — in case you’re not running on default.
- Image paths — they’re currently hardcoded.
- Add more templates and make your own custom senseis!

## Final Word

This isn’t a polished EdTech platform — it’s a fun, nerdy learning sidekick built by a coder who clearly watches anime and loves AI.  
Perfect for late-night coding marathons and last-minute exam cramming.

🧙‍♂️ *“When the student is ready, your sensei will appear.”*

Well... it already has. Start learning. 🤓
